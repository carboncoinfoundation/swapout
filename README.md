# Carboncoin Swapout Contract

The purpose of the swapout is to secure the holdings of existing holders of Carboncoin in a decentralised, secure way ahead of deploying the new network after the forthcoming ICO.

The contract creates a new token on the Ethereum blockchain that will be swapped for existing Carboncoin.

## Technical Instructions

These contracts for the Carboncoin Ethereum Swapout make use of [Truffle](truffleframework.com) and [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/).

### Running it locally

Install Ethereum TestRPC and Truffle:

`npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`

`npm install -g truffle`

Clone this repository and npm install. This will install Open Zeppelin.

### Deploying locally

Run the Ethereum testrpc in a terminal window:

`testrpc`

In a separate window, compile the project and run the migrations, deploying the contract to testrpc:

`truffle compile`

`truffle migrate`

###Â Deploying to Rinkeby test network

First things first you need a Rinkeby account with some Rinkeby ether in it. The [official Ethereum Wallet](https://ethereum.org/) is a good place to start.

You can get Rinkeby ether from [the Rinkeby faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet).

We need to tell Rinkeby and Truffle the address of this deploying account. We have therefore introduced a  CREATOR_ACCOUNT environment variable that returns the address of the deploying account.

You can set this manually or install direnv (`brew install direnv`) and update .envrc with the address of your account.

Easiest way to run a Rinkeby node locally is using geth:

`brew tap ethereum/ethereum`

`brew install ethereum`

You can then start it as follows:

`geth --rinkeby --rpc --unlock="$CREATOR_ACCOUNT"`

You will need to type in the password for your deploying account.

Now you can deploy the contract:

`truffle compile`

`truffle migrate --network rinkeby`
